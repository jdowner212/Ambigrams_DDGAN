# Ambigrams_dual_discrim_GAN

This repository includes my implementation of a dual-discriminator GAN that tries to draw a character that looks like two arbitrary letters at once -- one rightside-up, the other upside-down.

Includes notebook `Ambigrams.ipynb` to facilitate data collection, training, and visualization.
