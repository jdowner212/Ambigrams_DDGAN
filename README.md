# Ambigrams_dual_discrim_GAN

An ambigram is a series of characters that displays one message rightside-up and another (or same) message upside-down.
This repository includes my implementation of a dual-discriminator GAN that tries to draw a character that looks like two arbitrary letters at once -- one rightside-up, the other upside-down.

Includes notebook `Ambigrams.ipynb` to facilitate data collection, training, and visualization.



Examples above are my own work.
