# Ambigrams_dual_discrim_GAN

An ambigram is a series of characters that displays one message rightside-up and another (or same) message upside-down.

A simple example (own work):

This repository includes my implementation of a dual-discriminator GAN that tries to draw a character that looks like two arbitrary letters at once -- one rightside-up, the other upside-down.

### How it works

A GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) consists of two core parts -- a discriminator network and a generator network. The discriminator is trained to distinguish between 'real' and 'fake' images, and the generator is a convolutional neural network that performs a forward pass on randomly-generated values to produce an image.

In each round of training, the discriminator is provided with 'real' images (provided data) and 'fake' images (produced by the generator), along with their labels. It guesses whether each image it sees is real or fake and self-updates according to its success rate. The generator is penalized if the image it generates is recognized as fake, and updates itself accordingly. 

This implementation includes *two* discriminators and two datasets -- one for each letter. The first discriminator learns to recognize the first letter rightside-up -- the second does the same for the second letter turned upside-down. The generator penalized against both discriminators, so its updates incorporate information about both letters.

A few examples of images generated by this network:

### Included in this repository
1. `fonts`: contains data for 600 fonts
2. `data`: you will populate this folder yourself with the `add_augmented_data()` function (included in notebook). Generates images of each letter in upper/lower case of every font -- multiplies and transforms results to increase size of dataset.
3. `sample_images`: examples of ambigrams generated by this network
4. `models`: models I've trained with some success, plus whichever you train yourself.
5. `Ambigrams.ipynb`: notebook that facilitates the process of collecting data, training models, and visualizing results. Supported by several `.py` files:
- `my_DDGAN.py`: framework for the network + function to update the model during training
- `general_utils.py`: brief and boring functions to make our lives easier
- `file_utils.py`: retrieve/manipulate data and organize files
- `train_plot_save`: train/save models, display results
6. `observations/tips.txt`: what it sounds like.
